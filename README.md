## Description
In this challenge, I will build a portfolio page, which will  be used to chart the course progress.

## User Story
AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Notes
Submitted question on to Slack (AskkBCS Learning Assistance) concerning how to group columns together in a row.  Couldn't really provide that type of support so scheduled tutoring session for 3/5.

Tutor session on 3/6 to discuss responsive page issues
